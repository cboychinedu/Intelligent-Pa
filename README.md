# Description
This is an Intelligent personal Assistant that runs on a machine learning Algorithm for classification of different conversational labels. 
The Personal Assistant is capable of answering questions, and also capable of responding back in a simple conversation as well. 
It works by the use of a dataset that has 7 to 8 different labels and its corresponding samples of text (corpus) to train a classifier called Naive Bayes. 
The model generated is then called upon to predict the user input and make responses based on the predicted label. 
The model Accuracy score is 85.67% when tested against the test datatset, and some modification were made to increase it Accuracy.
